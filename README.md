Scientific Computation deals with basic issues related to the development and efficient use of computational tools that help in the practical use of mathematical models of science and technology, e.g. in simulations.  The course develops the background for the design of efficient algorithms and software for modern computer architectures for important large-scale computational problems based on the concept of models (mainly computational and numerical, with a brief introduction to the discrete model) and their use for predicting performance and error in modern computations.
