This project contains a computational lab exercise focusing on sparse matrix representations and register constructions using MATLAB. It includes the following key sections:

    Introduction to Computing Systems

        Recording the start and completion dates of the exercise.

        Describing the hardware and software used, including system specifications, MATLAB version, and benchmark results.

    Sparse Representations and Matrix Constructions

        CSR and CSC Representations: Implementing a MATLAB function (sp_mat2latex) to convert sparse matrices into LaTeX format using Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) and Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) formats.

        Block Toeplitz Tridiagonal Matrix Construction: Developing a function (blkToeplitzTrid(n,B,A,C)) to construct a block Toeplitz tridiagonal matrix efficiently.

        BCCS Representation: Implementing a function (sp_mx2bccs) to convert a sparse matrix into Block Compressed Column Storage (BCCS) format, which is a block-column storage representation.
